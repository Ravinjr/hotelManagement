      <h1>Madunagala Hot Springs</h1>
      <p>Madunagala Hot Water Springs lie amoung vast paddyfields between Sooriyawewa and Ridiyagama, Today this hot water well is one of the most popular destinations for the pilgrims to the South. The spring was first recorded by Leonard Woolf, Assistant Government Agent of Hambanthota (1908-11) in his diaries recording the haphazard journey through wild animal infested jungles and boat rides to reach the hot spring where he had taken sample to be analysed.</p>
      <p>The spring was rediscovered again in early 1960â€™s with the Uda Walawe development project when the areas coming under the Walawe Basin was turned in to vast agricultural area. Embilipitiya was made the primary town of the project where number of trunk roads from main towns in surrounding Embilipitiya was terminated. Sooriyawewa, about 15 km east of Embilipitiya became the central hub of the left bank region of the Uda Walawe reservoir.</p>
