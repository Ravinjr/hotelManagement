      <h1>Tissamaharama Temple</h1>
      <p>Considered to be one of the largest and most important Buddhist places of worship in the entire island, the Tissamaharama Raja Maha Viharaya is a temple that is hard to miss due to the gargantuan stupa that stands at a height of 156 feet, easily making it the largest temple in the southern region. The temple is believed to date back all the way to the 3rd century BC, during the reign of King Mahanaga of Ruhuna, shortly after Buddhism was established in the island. However, it was King Kavan Tissa that made the temple to its present state in the 2nd century BC. </p>
