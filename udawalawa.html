      <h1>Udawalawa National Park</h1>
      <p>Established in 1972, Udawalawe National Park is a great example of Sri Lanka's efforts to protect wildlife in an ethical and sustainable way.
        Primarily created to provide a sanctuary for the large population of wild elephants that lived in the area, as well as to protect the diverse range of flora and fauna found in the park, Udawalawe also provides a catchment area for the Udawalawe Reservoir, which is an important source of water for the surrounding area.</p>
      <p>Known for its amazing wildlife (read: elephants, and plenty of them!) and breathtaking landscapes, he park is nestled in the district of Uva, part of the Udawalawe reservoir, the largest water body in the dry zone of Sri Lanka, and covers an area of around 31,000 hectares.</p>
