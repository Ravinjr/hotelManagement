      <h1>Yala National Park</h1>
      <p>Located in the south eastern corner of Sri Lanka, Yala National Park is one of the best known wildlife parks.  Home to one of the world's largest population of leopards, it is the second largest national park on the island, behind Wilpattu National Park. It is roughly a 5 hour drive from Colombo, by vehicle, so get ready for an early morning start if you haven't made camp anywhere nearby.</p>
      <p>Yala is home to more than 200 species of birds and 40 species of mammals, but it is probably most well-known for its leopard population. There are more leopards per unit of land in Yala than almost anywhere else in the world, and the park is considered to have far more leopards sightings than any other national park on the island. It is best to visit between January and July to increase your chances of spotting these magnificent creatures.</p>
