      <h1>Usssangoda National Park</h1>
      <p>On the great Southern road just before you reach Ambalanthota the name board Ussangoda will no doubt attract your attention. The road turns seawards and after a few minutes drive and a climb uphill you reach a peculiar landscape shrouded in mystery and yet to be properly explored.</p>
      <p> The landscape that greets you is weird and wonderful. The vast land that extends on all sides has hardly any tall trees and is covered by a short grass or moss. In some places well defined circular islands of vegetation can be seen But these do not include any tall trees. The earth is of a dark red colour, giving the landscape a Martian look and the area is popularly believed to be bestowed with strange and mystical powers. Many are the legends and stories told of it.</p>
